If you have ever written a script in Python you surely know the importance of having a good command-line interface for your application.

And this is why today I'm posting here a link to another post I wrote for *Real Python* on this topic some months ago.

**[Real Python](https://www.realpython.com)** is one of the most important resources on the web about Python and I'm really proud to be part of that community full of brilliant people that share a common passion for this incredible programming language.

Happy Pythoning!
