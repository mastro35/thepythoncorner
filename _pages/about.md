If you are reading this page it means that you are interested in this project, so the first thing I want to tell you is **THANK YOU!**

But staying online and creating quality content costs real money. We invest all our knowledge, our passion and a lot of our time in this project and to stay online we need your help.

There are so many ways to help us: if you are a Python enthusiast you can just help us by making a donation to [our PayPal account](https://www.paypal.me/mastro35) or by sending bitcoin to the wallet 15zommQc52pu1bD95n9s31uskeAWDGhYzA.

If you are on Patreon, you can help us by visiting [our Patreon page](https://www.patreon.com/thepythoncorner) and choosing the tier you prefer.

Feel free to choose the amount you want to donate: **even a single dollar could be important to keep The Python Corner alive**!

If you prefer, you can also help us by buying items in our ["Gift Shop"](https://shop.spreadshirt.com/the-python-corner/). For each item purchased, you will donate $3 to the site and help make the Internet a better place.

If you are a company... have you ever considered the idea of sponsoring us? But hey, keep in mind that our ideas are not for sale, we do accept sponsorship only for products that we do really like!

Last but not least, if you have found some of our articles helpful, consider the idea of [offering us a coffee](https://www.buymeacoffee.com/dXjDHmt) just like you’d do with a colleague on your workplace.

And don't forget to talk about this site with your friends and colleague, we like visits! =)
