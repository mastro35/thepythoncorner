If you are reading this page it means that you are interested in this project, so the first thing I want to tell you is **THANK YOU!**

Staying online and creating quality content costs real money. I personally invest all my knowledge, my passion and a lot of my time in this project and so **I need your help**.

The first thing you can do is to actually **share** my articles. On Linkedin, on Twitter, on Facebook... wherever you want, whenever you want... just share them! A single click doesn't cost anthing to you but can do a lot of difference for me.

The second thing you can do is to **donate**.
Every single donation helps, regardless of how much you donate.

If you liked one of our articles or it saved you a lot of time you can thank us with a small donation of the amount that is right for you. 

You can choose to donate with Paypal by clicking on [this link](https://www.paypal.com/paypalme/mastro35) or [buying me a coffee](https://www.buymeacoffee.com/mastro35) just like you'd do with a colleague of yours.  
And if you are a "crypto-guy" with a couple of Bitcoins spare in your pocket, here is my wallet : 15zommQc52pu1bD95n9s31uskeAWDGhYzA :)

Feel free to choose the amount that is right for you: **even a single dollar could be important to keep The Python Corner alive**!

Beside, don't forget to visit our ["Swag Store"](https://shop.spreadshirt.com/the-python-corner/).  
For each item purchased, you will donate $3 to the site and help make the Internet a better place.

And last but not least... if you are a company... wouldn't it be great if you decided to be the official sponsor of The Python Corner? :)

Thank you all, very much.
